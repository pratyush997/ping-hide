# Ping Hide
 This program lets you mask (hide and unhide) pings. It uses Advanced Firewall rules to manipulate/toggle rules.
 It was a quick coded little app for my personal use, the code is not the best at all, there's a lot to be fixed and GUI changes are need.
 I do not plan to work on this application anymore due to trick being obsolute.

### For Multiplayer PC gamers

No more getting kicked out of the server due to high pings. Masking ping renders the admin of the servers and the scripts useless because the user can't be kicked out of the server due to high ping. Although, the admins have a workaround up where they can kick the user based on "missing ping". 
This little handy utility still works on couple of EU and SG servers. 
Cheers.

### I used netsh advfirewall commands with arguements to create and toggle the rule.
